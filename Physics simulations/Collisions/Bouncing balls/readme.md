This script attaches to a specific cirlce object which bounces around the screen with elastic collisions, with a velocity that increases by a multiplicative amount (~0.00001) every 1/60th of a second. It's fun to watch until about 200 grid quantities per 1/60th of a second where the collisions can't process quick enough and the ball flies away.
